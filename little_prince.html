    As the little prince dropped off to sleep, I took him in my arms and set out walking once more.
    <span class="underline">I felt deeply moved, and stirred. It seemed to me that I was carrying a very
        fragile treasure. </span>
    It <span class="orangeback">It seemed to me, even, that there was nothing more fragile on all Earth.</span>
    In the moonlight I looked at his pale forehead, his closed eyes, his locks of hair that trembled
    in the wind, and I said to myself: <span class="redbold">"What I see here is nothing but a shell.
    What is most important is invisible...‚Äù </span>
    As his lips opened slightly with the suspicion of a half-smile,
    I said to myself, again: <span class="redbold">"What moves me so deeply, about this little prince who is sleeping here,
    is his loyalty to a flower--the image of a rose that shines through his whole being like the flame of a
    lamp, even when he is asleep . . ." </span> And I felt him to be more fragile still. <span class="underline">
    I felt the need of protecting
    him, as if he himself were a flame that might be extinguished by a little puff of wind . . . </span>
